Welcome to my repository! My name is Dinesh Dhanraj Nuthalakanti, and I have created this collection of four major applications: Covid Application, Earthquake Application, Music Application, and FoodAppUI. Each of these applications is located within the src folder and its subfolders.

I have developed these applications using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, and have implemented server-side validation of credentials using the database. Additionally, I have created a Login & Signup Page to improve the user experience.

To showcase these applications, I have attached a video that demonstrates how they work in action. Please feel free to explore this repository and watch the video to get a better understanding of these applications. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to contact me. Thank you for considering my work!
